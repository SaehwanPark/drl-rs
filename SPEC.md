# Specification

Last reviewed: 2026-08-22
Current project version: `0.2.15`

The [Roadmap](docs/DRL-Rust_Project_Roadmap.md) owns overall milestone scope,
ordering, and delivery tracking. This file expands **exactly one active
implementation slice** into observable behavior, pure contracts, acceptance
criteria, and verification boundaries.

---

## 1. Status Vocabulary

- `[x]` — **Delivered and Verified**: Supported by checked repository evidence,
  tests, or artifacts.
- `[ ]` — **Present or Future Work**: Open implementation task or acceptance
  gate.
- `NOT_RUN` — **Environment Unavailable**: Required prerequisites (e.g., Linux
  x86-64 binary or browser WebGPU) were not present; not an inferred pass.
- `INCONCLUSIVE` — **Unresolved Evidence**: Output exists but cannot
  definitively satisfy criteria without additional evidence.

## 2. Active Implementation Slice: M10 Offline-Cache Readiness

### 2.1 Scope & Objective

Start service-worker registration during page bootstrap, independently of game
graphics and WebGPU startup. Report unavailable, installing, ready, and failed
registration states without changing simulation behavior. Real browser offline
installation remains an environment-gated acceptance item.

### 2.2 Predecessor Foundation (Delivered Slices)

1. **Release manifest and detached signing (v0.2.1–v0.2.14)**:
   - `release-manifest.json` records version, source identity, artifact hashes,
     generated files, rights metadata, and optional detached signature artifacts.
2. **Static service-worker boundary (v0.2.1–v0.2.14)**:
   - SHA-256 sidecars and service-worker checks validate every generated bundle
     without requiring secrets or external services; the worker has tested
     install, activate, navigation fallback, and same-origin GET behavior.

### 2.3 Present Slice Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Bootstrap registration**: Begin registration before the Start handler
  can reject unsupported WebGPU, and await the same readiness result after game
  startup for user-facing status.
- [x] **Capability and failure diagnostics**: Distinguish unavailable service
  workers, installation in progress, active registration, and registration
  failures without telemetry or simulation side effects.
- [x] **Bundle boundary**: Copy the registration helper into the generated
  static bundle and include it in release-manifest/service-worker coverage.
- [x] **Deterministic contract tests**: Cover capability, installing, ready,
  failure, and bootstrap ordering with injected browser capabilities.
- [ ] **Real browser acceptance**: Verify first-load installation and offline
  reload in an approved desktop Chromium environment.

### 2.4 Pure Contract

- **Input**: Browser service-worker capability and registration promise.
- **Output**: A descriptive readiness string; registration failures never throw
  into game startup and never mutate simulation state.
- **Ownership Boundary**:
  - `web/offline-cache.mjs` owns registration and diagnostics formatting.
  - `web/bootstrap.js` starts registration before graphics and reports its
    result after the simulation boot path.
  - The service worker owns cache lifecycle; offline behavior remains subject
    to controlled browser acceptance.

- [x] Versioned service-worker cache invalidation based on version and commit.
- [x] Mocked service worker lifecycle and fetch contract test harness.

### M11 — Cohort Telemetry & Outcome Projections (`VERSION` 0.1.1–0.2.3)

- [x] Fixed-seed cohort reports (`CohortConfig`, `CohortReport`) with integrity
  validation.
- [x] Cohort outcome distributions (victory, death, turn limit, stalled, in
  progress).
- [x] Pure outcome-rate and telemetry tolerance gates for regression detection.
- [x] Descriptive telemetry metrics: shot accuracy, damage dealt/taken, kills,
  pickups, and item usage.

## 4. Shared Observable Behavior & Invariants

### 4.1 Simulation & Fairness

- **Information Decoupling**: `BrowserSession` and MCP tools expose only fair
  `PlayerObservation` and `GameEvent` streams. Hidden world state is never
  accessible.
- **Replay Determinism**: Identical seed and command sequences produce bit-exact
  identical events and end states across headless, MCP, and browser runners.
- **Transactional Rollback**: Rejected or illegal commands roll back session
  state without advancing the simulation turn or consuming energy.

### 4.2 Browser & WebGPU Presentation

- **Input Translation**: Browser shell maps keyboard/numpad, wait, pickup,
  reload, descend, ranged targeting, and DOM inventory clicks directly to
  protocol `Command`s.
- **No Simulation Side Effects**: Canvas resize, DPR change, animation tick,
  audio playback, tab visibility change, or WebGPU device loss never advance
  simulation time.
- **Square-Cell Viewport**: Integer scaling and centering ensure square game
  tiles without non-uniform axis stretching.
- **Visibility-Derived Lighting**: Full light for tiles in active FOV; fixed fog
  factor for remembered explored tiles. Presentation never queries hidden
  tiles.

### 4.3 Evaluation & Telemetry

- **Contiguous Seeds**: Cohort reports record contiguous seed ranges and
  preserve per-seed replay logs.
- **Descriptive Metrics**: Projections report descriptive counts and rates; they
  do not assert balance conclusions or statistical significance.

### 4.4 Release Packaging

- **Manifest Validation**: Release scripts verify manifest schema, sorted
  SHA-256 hashes, license metadata, worker coverage, sidecar digests, and source
  commit identity.

---

## 5. Public Contracts & Boundaries

### 5.1 Protocol & Simulation (`drl-protocol`, `drl-core`)

- **Domain Types**: `Position`, `Direction`, `Turn`, `EntityId`, `ItemId`,
  `LevelId`, `HitPoints`, `Speed`, `ActionCost`.
- **Commands**: `Command::Move`, `Command::Wait`, `Command::Pickup`,
  `Command::Drop`, `Command::Equip`, `Command::Unequip`, `Command::Reload`,
  `Command::Use`, `Command::AttackMelee`, `Command::AttackRanged`,
  `Command::Descend`.
- **Observations**: `PlayerObservation` (FOV tiles, visible actors, ground
  items, inventory, equipment, player HP, map dimensions).
- **Events**: `GameEvent::AttackResolved`, `GameEvent::DamageApplied`,
  `GameEvent::ActorDied`, `GameEvent::ActorKnockedBack`,
  `GameEvent::PlayerTeleported`, `GameEvent::LevelTransitioned`, etc.

### 5.2 Presentation & Assets (`drl-render`, `drl-assets`, `drl-web`)

- **Layout**: `PixelViewport`, `PixelRect`, integer cell scaling.
- **Shading & Tone**: `LightingBand`, `shade_color`, `SceneTone`,
  `low_health_pulse_target_alpha`, `LowHealthPulseState`.
- **Draw Plans**: `layer_draw_plan`, `sprite_composite_plan`, `LayerRole`,
  `AtlasTextureSource`.
- **Decals & Particles**: `ParticleDecalPlacement`, `ParticleDecalInsertion`,
  `ParticleDecalStore`, burst origins/directions/ranges.

### 5.3 Decoupling Invariants

- `drl-core` and `drl-protocol` have **zero** dependencies on WebGPU, Web
  Audio, DOM, filesystem, network, or MCP crates.

## 6. Verification Gates

### Verified Baseline (`VERSION` 0.2.15)

af0fcf8 feat(release): add optional manifest signing (#105)
- [x] `sh scripts/check-repository.sh` — Full repository test suite, formatting,
  clippy, and harness checks.
- [x] `sh scripts/check-assets.sh` — 32 imported legacy PNGs, licensing, and
  SHA-256 checksums.
- [x] `scripts/test-reference-capture.sh` — Preflight fixture test suite for
  capture manifests.
- [x] `sh scripts/check-web.sh` — WASM target compilation and native/WASM web
  contract tests.
- [x] `sh scripts/build-web.sh && sh scripts/check-release-manifest.sh` — Static
  bundle build and 44-artifact manifest validation.
- [x] `scripts/check-version.sh` — Project version consistency and transition
  rules.

### Environment-Gated Verification

- [ ] Controlled Linux x86-64 reference captures (`NOT_RUN` on macOS arm64).
- [ ] Direct visual/audio diff against legacy reference captures (`NOT_RUN`).

## 7. Explicit Non-Goals

- **Pre-1.0 Multiplatform**: No WebGL2 fallback, mobile/touch UI, gamepad
  navigation, or native desktop packaging before the 1.0 desktop Chromium
  release.
- **No Runtime Scripting**: No Lua VM or JavaScript gameplay logic. All
  simulation is pure compiled Rust.
- **No Online Services**: No player accounts, multiplayer networking, or
  remote backend servers.
- **No Unattributed Assets**: No bundling of legacy audio, music, or fonts
  without documented redistribution rights.
- **No False Parity Claims**: Pure mathematical contracts and generated audio
  tones are not claimed as full legacy audiovisual equivalence until validated
  against reference captures.
